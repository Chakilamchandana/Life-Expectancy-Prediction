# Life-Expectancy-Prediction

Project Summary: Predicting Life Expectancy with GCP Compliance and SDLC Integration

This project revolves around predicting life expectancy based on a comprehensive analysis of various factors, including immunization rates, mortality rates, economic indicators, and other health-related variables. The project adheres to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards and integrates Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodologies to ensure robustness, compliance, and ethical considerations throughout the project lifecycle.

Key Components and Methodologies:

GCP Compliance: Ensures that the project follows GCP principles, including data quality, ethical considerations, regulatory compliance, validation, and documentation standards. Adherence to GCP guidelines is crucial for maintaining research integrity and ethical standards in health data analysis.
SDLC Integration: Integrates SDLC methodologies such as requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance into the project workflow. This structured approach ensures the reliability, scalability, and maintainability of the predictive models and analysis tools developed.

Project Phases:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Acquires and preprocesses a dataset containing information on factors influencing life expectancy, ensuring data quality and integrity in accordance with GCP standards.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducts EDA to understand relationships, trends, and patterns within the dataset, utilizing data visualization techniques to gain insights into key variables.
Feature Selection and Engineering: Selects relevant features and engineers new features that contribute significantly to predicting life expectancy, considering GCP guidelines for data selection and validation.
Model Development: Develops and trains regression models using methodologies such as Linear Regressor, Ridge Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, AdaBoost Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor, integrating GCP-compliant validation processes.
Model Evaluation and Validation: Evaluates model performance using accuracy score, r2 score, and other relevant metrics, validating the models against GCP standards for reliability and predictive accuracy.
Deployment and Maintenance: Deploys the predictive models in a production environment, following SDLC practices for deployment, monitoring, and ongoing maintenance to ensure continued performance and relevance.
Outcome and Impact:

The project's outcomes provide valuable insights into life expectancy prediction, supporting evidence-based healthcare decision-making and public health interventions. The integration of GCP compliance and SDLC methodologies ensures research integrity, ethical standards, and technical robustness, contributing to credible and impactful health data analysis and predictive modeling.
