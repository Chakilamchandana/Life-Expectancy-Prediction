# Life-Expectancy-Prediction

Project Summary: Predicting Life Expectancy

This project aims to analyze and predict life expectancy based on various factors such as immunization rates, mortality rates, economic indicators, and other health-related variables. The project acknowledges the significant impact of these factors on life expectancy, particularly in developing countries where health improvements have contributed to changes in mortality rates.

Key Components and Keywords:

Dataset: Utilizes a dataset containing information on factors such as alcohol consumption, adult mortality rate, immunization rates (e.g., Hepatitis, Diphtheria, Measles), GDP, and literacy rates.
Features: Examines a range of features related to health, economics, and demographics to understand their influence on life expectancy.
Preprocessing: Involves data preprocessing techniques to clean, transform, and prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling.
Data Visualization: Utilizes data visualization techniques to explore relationships, trends, and patterns within the dataset.
Target Variable: The target variable of interest is life expectancy, which serves as the focal point for prediction modeling.
Models: Implements various regression models including Linear Regressor, Ridge Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, AdaBoost Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor to predict life expectancy.
Evaluation Metrics: Evaluates model performance using accuracy score, r2 score, and other relevant metrics to assess predictive accuracy and reliability.
