# Life-Expectancy-Prediction

Project Summary: Predicting Life Expectancy

This project revolves around predicting life expectancy based on a comprehensive analysis of various factors, including immunization rates, mortality rates, economic indicators, and other health-related variables. The project integrates Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodologies to ensure robustness, compliance, and ethical considerations throughout the project lifecycle.

Key Components and Methodologies:

SDLC Integration: Integrates SDLC methodologies such as requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance into the project workflow. This structured approach ensures the reliability, scalability, and maintainability of the predictive models and analysis tools developed.

Project Phases:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Acquires and preprocesses a dataset containing information on factors influencing life expectancy, ensuring data quality and integrity.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducts EDA to understand relationships, trends, and patterns within the dataset, utilizing data visualization techniques to gain insights into key variables.
Feature Selection and Engineering: Selects relevant features and engineers new features that contribute significantly to predicting life expectancy
Model Development: Develops and trains regression models using methodologies such as Linear Regressor, Ridge Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, AdaBoost Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor.
Model Evaluation and Validation: Evaluates model performance using accuracy score, r2 score, and other relevant metrics, validating the models.
Deployment and Maintenance: Deploys the predictive models in a production environment, following SDLC practices for deployment, monitoring, and ongoing maintenance to ensure continued performance and relevance.
Outcome and Impact:

The project's outcomes provide valuable insights into life expectancy prediction, supporting evidence-based healthcare decision-making and public health interventions. The integration of SDLC methodologies ensures research integrity, ethical standards, and technical robustness, contributing to credible and impactful health data analysis and predictive modeling.
